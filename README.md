# Jiu: MVC implemented by Go standard library.

I like Go standard library and MVC pattern, how about make backend with both?
Jiu provide examples and tool sets to help you make easy testing, clean, and readable codes.This project inspired by many famous frameworks, Spring, Gin, etc.
The examples include simple RESTful APIs and show how to organize the project.
