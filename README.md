# Jiu: MVC implemented by Go standard library.

I like the Go standard library and MVC pattern, how about making the backend with both?

Jiu provides examples and toolsets to help you make easy testing, clean, and readable codes. This project was inspired by many famous frameworks, Spring, Gin, etc.

The examples include simple RESTful APIs and show how to organize the project.
